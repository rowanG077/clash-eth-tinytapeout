## Clash ethernet core

This project is a fully functional (hopefully) MII ethernet core that can respond to pings

# Tiny Tapeout Verilog Project Template

- [Read the documentation for project](docs/info.md)

## What is Tiny Tapeout?

Tiny Tapeout is an educational project that aims to make it easier and cheaper than ever to get your digital and analog designs manufactured on a real chip.

To learn more and get started, visit https://tinytapeout.com.

## Set up your Verilog project

1. Add your Verilog files to the `src` folder.
2. Edit the [info.yaml](info.yaml) and update information about your project, paying special attention to the `source_files` and `top_module` properties. If you are upgrading an existing Tiny Tapeout project, check out our [online info.yaml migration tool](https://tinytapeout.github.io/tt-yaml-upgrade-tool/).
3. Edit [docs/info.md](docs/info.md) and add a description of your project.
4. Adapt the testbench to your design. See [test/README.md](test/README.md) for more information.

The GitHub action will automatically build the ASIC files using [OpenLane](https://www.zerotoasiccourse.com/terminology/openlane/).

## What is Tiny Tapeout?

TinyTapeout is an educational project that aims to make it easier and cheaper than ever to get your digital designs manufactured on a real chip.

To learn more and get started, visit https://tinytapeout.com.

## Building the project locally

1. Install [OpenLane 2 with nix](https://openlane2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started/nix_installation/index.html).
   Set the `OPENLANE2_ROOT` environment variable to the path where you cloned the openlane2 repository.
2. Clone tt-support-tools: `git clone -b tt06 https://github.com/TinyTapeout/tt-support-tools tt`
3. Run the following command:

```bash
rm -rf runs && nix-shell ${OPENLANE2_ROOT}/shell.nix --run "python build.py"
```

The build.py script will create a runs directory and run the OpenLane flow. The results will be in the runs/wokwi directory.

When you run the build for the first time, nix will download all the dependencies. This can take a while, especially if you
haven't configured nix to use binary caches. Once the dependencies are downloaded, the build should take up to ten minutes.
